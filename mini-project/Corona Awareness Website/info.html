                <p><b>What are viruses?</b></p>
                A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 9,000 virus species have been described in detail of the millions of types of viruses in the environment. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology.</li>

                <p><b>COVID-19</b></p>
                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.

                Globally there have been 253,640,693 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 5,104,899 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 14 November 2021, a total of 7,307,892,664 vaccine doses have been administered.<br>

                    <p><b>How to make your environment safer</b></p>
                Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.
            Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing.
         The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.
  Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.
  For more information on how to hold events like family gatherings, children’s football games and family occasions, read our Q&A; on small public gatherings.
  Avoid crowded or indoor settings but if you can’t, then take precautions:
  Open a window. Increase the amount of ‘natural ventilation’ when indoors.
  WHO has published Q & A; on ventilation and air conditioning for both the general public and people who manage public spaces and buildings.
  Wear a mask</li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Dont forget the basics of hyginene</b></p>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.
Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.

                    <p><b>What to do if you feel unwell</b></p>
                    Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhoea, or a skin rash.
Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others.
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first, if you can and follow the directions of your local health authority.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health units are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

                    <p><b>Significance of Vaccine</b></p>
                    Vaccinations against Covid-19 were developed using science that has been in the books for ages. These vaccines are not experimental. They have been through all the stages of development for any new scientific breakthrough. In addition, Covid-19 specific vaccinations are constantly monitored by multiple health organizations purely because of all the pandemonium this virus has caused across the world. Hence, it becomes crucial for every citizen to take part in the vaccination drives organized by their local governmental bodies and other bodies offering the vaccine officially. Here’s a list of important details about vaccinations that make it absolutely necessary for you to NOT miss vaccination against Covid-19.</li>

                    <li><p><b>Covid-19 Vaccines are effective -</b></p>
                    
                    Covid-19 vaccines have been tested by multiple drug administration authorities in the world. They are proven to be effective in reducing your probability of contracting COVID-19.</li>
                    
                    <li><p><b>You are contributing to mass wellness by getting vaccinated -</b></p>
                    
                    Once you are vaccinated, your body is much better prepared to shield off more viruses by making your immune system stronger. At the same time, when you are protecting yourself, you are also protecting those around you.</li>
                    
                    <li><p><b>A safe way to build your immune system:</b></p>
                    
                    Vaccinations are known to boost your immune system by teaching your body how to fight threats. Therefore many consider vaccinations as a way to build up your immune system and the manner in which your body reacts to foreign bodies.</li>
                    
                    <li><p><b>No Covid Vaccines can infect you with Covid:</b></p>
                    
                    Many believe falsely that since the vaccine includes a strand of the virus, you may actually get infected by it. That is not how a virus affects a body and hence you are in no danger by being infected with the disease of the vaccine.</li>
                    
                    <li><p><b>Covid Vaccines are certified by multiple bodies</b></p>
                    
                    The Covid Vaccinations that are available by societies, governments and other people-body, are all certified by multiple certification authorities that have very stringent measures of success. If a vaccine is certified, you can be certain it has been tested through proven methods.
